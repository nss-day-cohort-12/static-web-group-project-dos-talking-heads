      <section>
        <p>From our humble beginnings as a small lumberjacking firm, to our current status as purveyor of fine paper and paper accessories, TALKING HEADS PAPER COMPANY has existed with one goal in mind: to give you, the customer, exactly what you want.</p>

        <h4 class="employee-name">Dylan</h4>
        <p><img class="headshot" src="http://assets.inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2012/07/Yoyo-Ferro-Yoda-Origami-537x405.jpg" alt="Yogurt"></p>
        <p>Dylan was a legendary Jedi Master and stronger than most in his connection with the Force. Small in size but wise and powerful, he trained Jedi for over 800 years, playing integral roles in the Clone Wars, the instruction of Luke Skywalker, and unlocking the path to immortality.</p>

        <h4 class="employee-name">William</h4>
        <p><img class="headshot" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_fVT75SDoq0/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="T-Rex"></p>
        <p>William is one of (if not "the") most famous of all dinosaurs. Tyrannosaurus is the last and largest of the Tyrannosaurs. Commonly known as "T. rex", this infamous species lived during the Late Cretaceous Period in modern day North America and was therefore among one of the last non-avian dinosaurs. Like other tyrannosaurids, Tyrannosaurus had very short arms with only two fingers. Although these were probably nearly useless while hunting, its jaws were not: Tyrannosaurus has an enormous skull armed with teeth the size of bananas.</p>

        <h4 class="employee-name">Mark</h4>
          <p><img class="headshot" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kUsxMXwCW8A/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Dragon"></p>
          <p>Mark  is a young, energetic, violet Dragon with orange medium-sized wings, large, curved horns (most of the time), a spiral-shaped spike on the tip of his tail, and spikes resembling a mohawk. He is noticeably smaller than most other dragons portrayed in the series; a characteristic that aids him in the first game. In the original series, most dragons are depicted as bipedal; however, Spyro is depicted as quadrupedal. </p>
